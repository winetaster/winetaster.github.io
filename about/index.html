    WineTaster is a modern update to the
    <a href="http://www.quandt.com/wine1.html">Classic WINETASTERÂ® app</a>
    developed by

  <p>
    WINETASTER is a program that allows you to analyze the rankings or grades
    assigned to wines in a "blind" tasting by a number of judges. You can ask
    the participants in the tasting to "rank" wines, i.e., assign ranks such as
    1 (for the one a judge liked best), 2, etc. The program will ask you to
    input the names of the "judges," their rankings or grades of the wines, and
    only after all the ranks or grades have been entered will it ask you to
    input the names of the individual wines (which should not be revealed before
    all the ranks or grades have been entered). (Normally, in a tasting you
    might be told which wines you will be drinking, but the bottles will be
    covered and identified only with letters such as A, B, C, etc., so that you
    do not know which wine is which). For example tasting reports, check out the
    archive at <a href="http://liquidasset.com/rep.htm">Liquid Asset</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    WINETASTER will then compute a number of statistical measures to identify:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The degree of agreement or disagreement among the judges</li>
    <li>
      The ranksums for each wine (i.e., the sums of the ranks assigned to each
      wine by the various judges; the higher the ranksum to lower it is ranked)
    </li>
    <li>
      The correlation between the rankings (or grades) of each judge with the
      average ranking of the other judges (i.e., who is the "odd person out")
    </li>
    <li>
      The perceived quality of the wines by the group of judges and its
      statistical significance
    </li>
    <li>
      The information that is computed is then arranged by the program in a
      ready-to-print report, with the additional option that you may add
      descriptive comments on the significance of the tasting.

  </ul>
